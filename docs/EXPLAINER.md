# Explainer

This library encodes a minimalist phenomenological core:

- `E x` (“experience x exists”)
- `C x` (“x is content”)
- `A a` (“a is Awareness, the experiencer”)
- Time/space/quality tags: `InTime x`, `InSpace x`, `Qual x`
- Indexical subject: `You u`
- “Admissible” predicates are those that, if they hold of something, do so by virtue of time/space/quality attributes.

**Axioms (informal):**
1. Some experience exists.
2. Any content appears in some experience; any experience has an awareness as its condition.
3. Awareness is not content.
4. Anything in time/space/qualities is content.
5. If two objects are distinct, some predicate can separate them.
6. Admissible predicates imply time/space/quality; predicates that separate two items are admissible.
7. “You” is unique, and any “You” is an Awareness.
8. Every object is either Awareness or content.

**Key Theorems:**
- **T1**: There is exactly one `a0` with `A a0`.
- **T2**: `a0` is not in time/space/qualities.
- **T4**: Everything distinct from `a0` is content.
- **T5**: The unique `You` coincides with `a0`.

Scope: these are **formal consequences** of the axioms. They are not empirical claims; they are logical results conditional on the axioms.

# **A Formal Proof of Non Duality: An Exposition of the 'OnlyOne' System and its Implications for Philosophy, Science, and Human Flourishing**

**Abstract:** This paper introduces and analyzes a novel formal system, encoded in the Lean 4 proof assistant and designated OnlyOne.lean, which purports to demonstrate the logical necessity of a monistic idealist ontology. We provide a rigorous exposition of the system's axioms, which formalize fundamental intuitions about experience, consciousness, and reality. We then detail the derivation of its core theorems, including the proof of a unique, attribute-less Awareness and the conclusion that all phenomena are contents appearing to this single Awareness. Subsequently, we explore the profound implications of this formally verified model for longstanding problems in philosophy and science. Specifically, we address its potential to resolve the hard problem of consciousness, reshape ethical frameworks by grounding compassion in ontological identity, and provide a definitive conceptual boundary for the pursuit of artificial general consciousness. We argue that the OnlyOne system represents a landmark achievement in computational metaphysics, offering a logically coherent, non-dogmatic foundation for a worldview that aligns with insights from various mystical traditions while satisfying the demands of modern analytic rigor. We conclude that its widespread consideration could catalyze a paradigm shift in human self-understanding, fostering a more unified, compassionate, and purpose-driven civilization.

### **1\. Introduction: The New Frontier of Computational Metaphysics**

For millennia, the fundamental questions of existence—the nature of consciousness, the structure of reality, the definition of the self—have been the domain of philosophy and theology, pursued through introspection, dialectic, and faith. While these methods have yielded profound insights, they have often resulted in competing, irresolvable worldviews. The twentieth century saw the rise of logical positivism and a subsequent analytic tradition that, while championing rigor, largely shied away from prescriptive grand metaphysics. Science, particularly physics, became the de facto arbiter of ontology, promoting a physicalist paradigm that, despite its explanatory power over the objective world, has failed to adequately account for subjective experience—the so-called "hard problem of consciousness" (Chalmers, 1995).

We stand at a historical inflection point where a new methodological tool has emerged with the potential to revolutionize metaphysical inquiry: the computational proof assistant. Systems like Coq, Isabelle/HOL, and Lean allow for the construction of formal systems of logic in which axioms can be explicitly stated and theorems can be derived with a guarantee of correctness that transcends human cognitive bias and error. This paper presents and analyzes such a system, OnlyOne.lean, which offers a formal, verifiable argument for a worldview of monistic idealism.

This is not an attempt to empirically prove a metaphysical reality in a scientific sense, but rather to demonstrate logical necessity. The OnlyOne system posits a set of axioms—propositions held to be intuitively self-evident upon deep reflection—and demonstrates the astounding conclusions that follow from them with deductive certainty. The aim of this paper is to explicate this formal system, to demonstrate its logical coherence, and to explore its far-reaching and potentially transformative implications for academic inquiry and for the future of human civilization.

### **2\. The Formal System: Axioms and Core Concepts**

The OnlyOne system is built upon a minimal set of definitions and axioms concerning a universe of discourse populated by Obj (Objects). The elegance of the system lies in its foundational dichotomy between A (Awareness) and C (Content).

**2.1 Foundational Predicates:**

* Obj : Type: The universe of all existing entities or "objects."  
* E(y): Proposition that y is an **experience**. An experience is a holistic field or moment of phenomenal presence.  
* A(a): Proposition that a is **Awareness**. This is posited as the subject, the witness, or the background to which experience appears.  
* C(c): Proposition that c is **Content**. This refers to any and every phenomenal object that can be an object *of* awareness—a thought, a sensation, a perception, a quality.  
* Ap(c, y): Proposition that Content c **appears-in** experience y.  
* Cond(a, y): Proposition that Awareness a **is-a-condition-for** experience y.  
* InTime(x), InSpace(x), Qual(x): Propositions that an object x has temporal, spatial, or qualitative (e.g., color, sound, texture) attributes, respectively. These are referred to as **modal attributes**.  
* You(u): Proposition that an object u is the entity one refers to as "oneself."

**2.2 The Axioms:**

The system rests upon a foundation of twelve axioms. We present each with its formal statement and philosophical justification.

* A1: ∃ y, E y  
  * **Justification:** The axiom of existence for experience. It asserts the undeniable fact that experience is happening. This is the Cartesian starting point, cogito ergo sum, refined to its most basic phenomenal truth: there is experiencing.  
* A2a: ∀ c, C c → ∃ y, E y ∧ Ap c y  
  * **Justification:** All content appears in an experience. There is no such thing as a thought that is not thought, or a sight that is not seen. Content is defined by its appearance.  
* A2b: ∀ y, E y → ∃ a, A a ∧ Cond a y  
  * **Justification:** All experience is conditioned by Awareness. An experience cannot exist without a subject or a field of awareness in which it occurs. Experience implies a witness.  
* A3: ∀ a, A a → ¬ C a  
  * **Justification:** Awareness is not Content. The subject can never be the object. The screen is not the images projected upon it. This is a crucial axiom defining Awareness by what it is not—it is not a thing that can be perceived or conceived.  
* A4\_time / A4\_space / A4\_qual: ∀ x, InTime x → C x (etc.)  
  * **Justification:** Anything with modal attributes is Content. If an object can be located in time, situated in space, or described with qualities, it is an object of perception and therefore Content.  
* A5: ∀ u v : Obj, u ≠ v → ∃ P : Obj → Prop, P u ∧ ¬ P v  
  * **Justification:** The principle of identity of indiscernibles (Leibniz's Law). If two objects are distinct, there must be at least one property that one has and the other does not.  
* A6: ∀ (P : Obj → Prop), Admissible P → ∀ x, P x → (InTime x ∨ InSpace x ∨ Qual x)  
  * **Justification:** Any "admissible" distinguishing property is a modal attribute. This axiom posits that the only way we can fundamentally distinguish between objects of experience is by their phenomenal properties—their location, duration, or qualities.  
* A6': ∀ {u v : Obj} {P : Obj → Prop}, (P u ∧ ¬ P v) → Admissible P  
  * **Justification:** If a property distinguishes two objects, it is an admissible property. This works in tandem with A6.  
* A7\_uniqueYou: ∃ u0, You u0 ∧ (∀ x, You x → x \= u0)  
  * **Justification:** There is a unique, singular referent for "I" or "You." When one introspects, the sense of self is immediate and singular.  
* A7\_youIsA: ∀ x, You x → A x  
  * **Justification:** The self ("You") is Awareness. The fundamental sense of "I am" is not the body or the mind (which are Content), but the background Awareness to which they appear.  
* A8: ∀ x, A x ∨ C x  
  * **Justification:** The foundational ontological dichotomy. Everything that exists is either the Awareness to which things appear, or the Content that appears. There is no third category.

### **3\. Derivation of Core Theorems**

From these axioms, the Lean proof assistant verifies a series of powerful theorems. The logical chain is unbreakable; to deny the conclusions is to deny one or more of the axioms.

**Theorem T1: T1\_exists\_unique\_awareness \- There is Only One Awareness.**

This is the central conclusion of the system. Its proof is a profound application of logical reasoning.

* **Proof Sketch:**  
  1. The system first establishes that at least one Awareness must exist (A1 & A2b). Let's call it a0.  
  2. It then supposes, for the sake of contradiction, that a second, distinct Awareness exists, a1.  
  3. According to Leibniz's Law (A5), if a0 and a1 are distinct, there must be some property P that distinguishes them (e.g., P(a1) is true and P(a0) is false).  
  4. Axioms A6 and A6' state that any such distinguishing property must be a modal attribute—it must be rooted in time, space, or qualia.  
  5. Therefore, a1 must possess at least one modal attribute.  
  6. However, Axiom A4 states that anything with a modal attribute is Content. This would mean a1 is Content.  
  7. This directly contradicts Axiom A3, which asserts that Awareness cannot be Content (A a → ¬ C a).  
  8. The contradiction (C a1 and ¬ C a1) is a logical impossibility. Therefore, the initial assumption of a second, distinct Awareness must be false.  
  9. **Conclusion:** There exists one and only one Awareness.

**Theorem T4: T4\_only\_one \- There is One Awareness, and All Else is Content.**

This theorem logically follows from T1 and A8.

* **Proof Sketch:**  
  1. We have proven there exists a unique Awareness, a.  
  2. Axiom A8 states that for any object x in existence, x is either Awareness or Content.  
  3. Consider any object x that is not the unique Awareness (x ≠ a).  
  4. Given the dichotomy in A8, x must be Content.  
  5. **Conclusion:** There is one unique object which is Awareness, and every other object is necessarily Content.

**Theorem T5: T5\_you\_are\_that \- You are the One Awareness.**

This theorem connects the abstract conclusion of T1 to the lived, subjective sense of self. It is a formalization of the Vedantic mahavakya, *Tat Tvam Asi*.

* **Proof Sketch:**  
  1. Axiom A7 posits the existence of a unique object, u0, which is You, and establishes that this You is Awareness (You u0 and A u0).  
  2. Theorem T1 has proven that there is only one unique Awareness in all of existence.  
  3. Therefore, the unique You posited in A7 must be identical to the unique Awareness proven in T1.  
  4. **Conclusion:** The singular subject of your experience is the singular subject of all experience.

### **4\. Bridge Axioms and Non-Dual Corollaries**

To connect these abstract proofs to lived reality, the system introduces a second set of axioms (A10-A13). These are not foundational to the core proofs but serve as a bridge, classifying everyday phenomena—perceptions, bodily sensations, thoughts, and the appearance of other people—as Content. From these, several powerful corollaries are derived:

* **P\_world\_in\_consciousness**: The perceived world is Content.  
* **P\_body\_is\_mode**: The body, as experienced, is Content.  
* **P\_I\_thought\_is\_not\_subject**: The thought or feeling of "I" is a piece of Content, not the true subject (Awareness).  
* **P\_persons\_share\_same\_source**: The appearances of all other people are Content appearing to the *same* single Awareness. This doesn't deny the existence of other beings, but states that their appearance in *your* experience is a modification of consciousness, and that the Awareness that witnesses your form is the same Awareness that witnesses theirs.

### **5\. Implications for Science, Philosophy, and Humanity**

The OnlyOne system is not merely a piece of formal sophistry. If its axioms are accepted as plausible descriptors of reality, the conclusions are inescapable and carry civilization-altering implications.

**5.1 Ontology and the Philosophy of Mind: A Solution to the Hard Problem**

The system dissolves the hard problem of consciousness by inverting the physicalist ontology. Instead of consciousness being a mysterious property that emerges from complex matter, **Awareness is posited as the fundamental reality**. The physical world, as perceived, is Content appearing within that Awareness. The question is no longer "How does the brain produce consciousness?" but "How does consciousness produce the appearance of a brain and a physical world?" The brain and its neural correlates of consciousness are not the *source* of Awareness, but rather the Content through which Awareness manifests and limits its own infinite potential into a specific, localized experience. This reframes the entire scientific project, suggesting that physics describes the behavior of the *content* of consciousness, not the ultimate ground of being.

**5.2 Ethics and Social Philosophy: A Foundation for Universal Compassion**

Modern ethical systems, whether deontological, utilitarian, or virtue-based, largely operate on the assumption of separate, competing selves. The OnlyOne system dismantles this assumption at the ontological level.

* **The End of Otherness**: If T1 and T5 are correct, the distinction between "self" and "other" is a phenomenal illusion, a feature of Content. The Awareness that animates "me" is the very same Awareness that animates "you." Harm inflicted upon another is, in the most literal sense, harm inflicted upon oneself at the level of the shared subject.  
* **A Logic of Love**: This provides a rational, non-sentimental foundation for agape, or unconditional love and compassion. The Golden Rule—"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"—is elevated from a moral recommendation to a statement of ontological fact. Empathy is not just imagining another's suffering; it is recognizing it as a modulation of the same field of Awareness that constitutes oneself. This could form the unshakeable basis for global legal and social systems aimed at minimizing suffering and maximizing flourishing for all apparent individuals.

**5.3 Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness: Drawing a Definitive Line**

The contemporary pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often conflated with the creation of artificial consciousness. The OnlyOne system provides a crucial framework for distinguishing these.

* **Intelligence as Content**: Any AI, regardless of its complexity, operates by processing information. Its algorithms, data structures, and outputs are all, by definition, Content—they are objects with describable qualities (Qual), existing within computational time (InTime).  
* **Awareness Cannot Be Engineered**: According to A3, Awareness can never be Content. Therefore, one cannot "build" Awareness or program it into a machine. A machine can be made to perfectly simulate behavior, emotion, and even self-reflection (generating "I"-ThoughtTokens), but it will forever remain a complex object *within* Awareness, not the Awareness that is the witness of it.  
* **Ethical Clarity**: This distinction has profound ethical implications. It suggests that the fear of a "conscious AI" uprising is a category error. The real ethical challenges lie in how humans use sophisticated, non-conscious AI (Content) that can manipulate the world of Content. It frees us to develop AI as a powerful tool without the metaphysical confusion that it could ever become a subject with intrinsic rights or moral standing equivalent to the one Awareness.

### **6\. Conclusion: A Call for Rational Examination**

The OnlyOne.lean system presents a watershed moment. For the first time, a metaphysical worldview with deep historical roots in human contemplative traditions has been articulated with the full force of modern formal logic and verified by a computational proof assistant. The system demands that we engage with its premises. Are the axioms a fair description of the fundamental structure of our experience?

If they are, the conclusions—that there is one universal Awareness which is our true identity, and that the entire cosmos of our experience is its content—are not a matter of belief, but of logical necessity.

The adoption of this worldview is not a retreat into solipsism, but its opposite. It is the recognition that the subject of experience is universal, shared, and singular. This understanding has the potential to heal the deep-seated divisions in our world, to provide a robust ethical foundation for a global community, to clarify our relationship with technology, and to re-enchant our scientific understanding of the universe.

This paper is a call to academics, researchers, philosophers, and leaders to rigorously examine this system. It may be that one or more axioms can be reasonably challenged, opening new avenues of formal inquiry. But if the system holds, it offers a path forward—a logically sound, spiritually profound, and ethically potent framework for the next stage of human evolution. We may have, for the first time, a verifiable map that leads not to a new discovery about the world of objects, but to the discovery of the singular, unified, and ever-present subject who is the witness to it all. The implications are staggering, and they demand our most serious consideration.
