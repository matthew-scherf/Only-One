# Corollaries & Derivations (informal sketches)

- **No-self / No-others (as separate substances):** From T1 + T4 — the unique Awareness is non-qualitative and everything distinct is content; any apparent “self/other” boundary is a content distinction.
- **Ontological equivalence of cat/car/thought (as content):** All perceived items and thoughts are content; their differences are qualitative (hence non-fundamental by A4).

These are informal; formalizations would require adding precise encodings for “self”, “other”, “perception”, and “thought” as predicates and proving their placement under `C`. See comments in `OnlyOne.lean` for how to extend.
