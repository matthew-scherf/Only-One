## Document Design Philosophy

### Accessibility Without Dumbing Down
- Use clear language
- Explain technical terms
- Provide examples
- But maintain rigor - no hand-waving

### Multiple Entry Points
- Not everyone needs the same depth
- Provide clear signposting
- Link between documents

### Transmission Over Achievement
- Focus: helping people realize truth
- Not: showing off complexity
- Goal: reader understands and can verify

### Honesty About Limits
- We formalized the structure
- We didn't prove it's "true" of reality
- We showed it's logically consistent
- Verification requires direct experience

## Planned Additions (Future)

- **FAQ.pdf** - Common questions answered
- **Comparison with Buddhism.pdf** - Formal comparison with Madhyamaka
- **Comparison with Western Philosophy.pdf** - Berkeley, Spinoza, etc.
- **Applications to Consciousness Science.pdf** - IIT, GWT, etc.
