## Lemmas

### **L1. The Absolute Transcends Phenomenal Properties**
```
∀a [A(a) → (¬T(a) ∧ ¬S(a) ∧ ¬Q(a))]
```
*For all a, if a is absolute, then a is not temporal, not spatial, and has no qualities*

**Equivalently:**
```
∀a [A(a) → ¬Φ(a)]
```

**Proof:**
```
Assume A(a).
Suppose T(a).
  Then Φ(a) by D1.
  Then C(a) by A4.
  But ¬C(a) by A3.
  Contradiction.
Therefore ¬T(a).
Similarly: ¬S(a) and ¬Q(a).
Therefore ¬T(a) ∧ ¬S(a) ∧ ¬Q(a). ∎
```

---

### **L2. No Admissible Property Holds of the Absolute**
```
∀a ∀P [(A(a) ∧ AdmissibleProp(P)) → ¬Holds(P,a)]
```
*For all a and properties P, if a is absolute and P is admissible, then P does not hold of a*

**Proof:**
```
Assume A(a) and AdmissibleProp(P).
Suppose Holds(P,a).
  Then Φ(a) by A6.
  Then C(a) by A4.
  But ¬C(a) by A3.
  Contradiction.
Therefore ¬Holds(P,a). ∎
```

---

## Main Theorems

### **T1. Uniqueness of the Absolute**
```
∃!a A(a)
```
*There exists exactly one absolute*

**Expanded form:**
```
∃a (A(a) ∧ ∀a' (A(a') → a' = a))
```

**Proof Sketch:**
```
Existence:
  By A1, ∃y E(y).
  By A2b, this y has an absolute condition a.
  Therefore ∃a A(a).

Uniqueness:
  Suppose A(a₁) and A(a₂).
  By A1, let y be an existent.
  By A2b, ∃!a (A(a) ∧ Cond(a,y)).
  Both a₁ and a₂ condition y (as both are absolute).
  By uniqueness in A2b, a₁ = a₂. ∎
```

---

### **T2. The Absolute and Conditioned Are Mutually Exclusive**
```
∀x [A(x) → ¬C(x)] ∧ ∀x [C(x) → ¬A(x)]
```
*No entity is both absolute and conditioned*

**Proof:**
```
First conjunct: A3 (immediate).
Second conjunct:
  Assume C(x).
  Suppose A(x).
  Then ¬C(x) by A3.
  Contradiction.
  Therefore ¬A(x). ∎
```

---

### **T3. The Absolute Is Not Phenomenal**
```
∀a [A(a) → ¬Φ(a)]
```
*The absolute is not phenomenal*

**Proof:**
```
This is L1 restated. ∎
```

---

### **T4. Everything Except the Absolute Is Conditioned**
```
∃a [A(a) ∧ ∀x (x ≠ a → C(x))]
```
*There exists an absolute a such that everything distinct from a is conditioned*

**Proof:**
```
By T1, let a₀ be the unique absolute.
Let x be arbitrary with x ≠ a₀.
By A8, A(x) ∨ C(x).
If A(x), then x = a₀ by T1.
But x ≠ a₀ by assumption.
Therefore C(x). ∎
```

---

### **T5. Identity of Subject and Absolute**
```
∃u [Y(u) ∧ A(u) ∧ ∀v (Y(v) → v = u)]
```
*There exists a unique you which is the absolute*

**Proof:**
```
By A7, ∃!u Y(u). Let u₀ be this unique subject.
By A7a, Y(u₀) → A(u₀).
Since Y(u₀), we have A(u₀).
Uniqueness of u₀ follows from A7. ∎
```

---

### **T6. Unique Grounding (Restatement)**
```
∀y [E(y) → ∃!a (A(a) ∧ Cond(a,y))]
```
*Every existent has exactly one absolute ground*

**Proof:**
```
This is A2b (axiomatic). ∎
```

---

### **T7. The Subject Transcends All Properties**
```
∃u [Y(u) ∧ ∀P (AdmissibleProp(P) → ¬Holds(P,u))]
```
*There exists a you to which no admissible property applies*

**Proof:**
```
By T5, ∃u where Y(u) and A(u).
By L2, since A(u), ∀P (AdmissibleProp(P) → ¬Holds(P,u)). ∎
```

---

## Main Result: Tat Tvam Asi

### **THEOREM (That Thou Art)**
```
∃!u [Y(u) ∧ A(u) ∧ ∀P (AdmissibleProp(P) → ¬Holds(P,u))]
```
*There exists exactly one "you" which is the absolute and to which no phenomenal property applies*

**Complete expanded form:**
```
∃u (Y(u) ∧ A(u) ∧ ¬T(u) ∧ ¬S(u) ∧ ¬Q(u) ∧ ∀v (Y(v) → v = u))
```

**Proof:**
```
By T5: ∃!u where Y(u) and A(u).
By L1: Since A(u), we have ¬T(u) ∧ ¬S(u) ∧ ¬Q(u).
By L2: Since A(u), ∀P (AdmissibleProp(P) → ¬Holds(P,u)).
Uniqueness follows from T5. ∎
```

## Derived Consequences

### **C1. Exactly Two Categories**
```
∀x [A(x) ⊕ C(x)]
```
*Every entity is either absolute or conditioned, but not both*

Where ⊕ denotes exclusive or.

---

### **C2. The Absolute Grounds All Existence**
```
∀y [E(y) → ∃a (A(a) ∧ Cond(a,y))]
```
*Everything that exists is grounded by the absolute*

---

### **C3. Phenomena Constitute the Conditioned Realm**
```
∀x [Φ(x) ↔ C(x)] ∨ [∃a A(a)]
```
*The phenomenal and conditioned realms coincide (given at least one absolute exists)*

---

### **C4. You Are Not Phenomenal**
```
∀u [Y(u) → ¬Φ(u)]
```
*The subject is not phenomenal*

**Proof:**
```
By A7a: Y(u) → A(u).
By L1: A(u) → ¬Φ(u).
Therefore: Y(u) → ¬Φ(u). ∎
```

---

### **C5. You Are Not Conditioned**
```
∀u [Y(u) → ¬C(u)]
```
*The subject is not conditioned*

**Proof:**
```
By A7a: Y(u) → A(u).
By A3: A(u) → ¬C(u).
Therefore: Y(u) → ¬C(u). ∎
```

---

## Alternative Formulations

### **Minimal Form (Three Axioms + Definition)**

If we want the most compact system:

```
D.  Φ(x) ≡ T(x) ∨ S(x) ∨ Q(x)

A1. ∃y E(y)
A2. ∀y [E(y) → ∃!a (A(a) ∧ Cond(a,y))] ∧ ∀a [A(a) → ¬Φ(a)]
A3. ∃!u [Y(u) ∧ A(u)]

    ∴ Y(u) ∧ A(u) ∧ ¬Φ(u)
```

This captures the essence while sacrificing some intermediate structure.

---

### **Modal Form**

Using modal operators (□ = necessarily, ◊ = possibly):

```
□∃y E(y)                           [Necessary existence]
□∀y [E(y) → ∃!a (A(a) ∧ Cond(a,y))]    [Necessary unique grounding]
□∀a [A(a) → ¬Φ(a)]                 [Necessarily, absolute transcends phenomena]
□∃!u [Y(u) ∧ A(u)]                 [Necessarily, unique subject-absolute identity]

    ∴ □[Y(u) ∧ A(u)]
```

---

### **Categorical Form**

Using category theory notation (advanced):

```
Let 𝔼 = category of existents
Let 𝔸 = category with one object (the Absolute)
Let Φ = category of phenomena

Then: Cond: 𝔸 → 𝔼 is initial object
      Y: 1 → 𝔸 is isomorphism
      Φ ⊂ 𝔼 \ 𝔸
```

This captures the structure as categorical relationships.

## Summary: The Five Essential Axioms

For stone tablet or maximal memorability:

```
Ⅰ.   ∃y E(y)                                [Existence]
Ⅱ.   ∀y [E(y) → ∃!a (A(a) ∧ Cond(a,y))]   [Unique Grounding]
Ⅲ.   ∀a [A(a) ↔ ¬Φ(a)]                     [Transcendence]
Ⅳ.   ∃!a A(a)                               [Uniqueness]
Ⅴ.   ∃!u [Y(u) ∧ A(u)]                      [Identity]

     ∴ tat tvam asi
```

---

## The Ultimate Minimal Expression

If forced to carve only ONE formula capturing everything:

```
∃!u [Y(u) ∧ A(u) ∧ ∀y(E(y) → Cond(u,y)) ∧ ¬Φ(u)]
```

**Reading:** *There exists exactly one You, which is Absolute, which grounds all existence, and which transcends all phenomena.*

This is the entire system in a single line.

## Meta-Logical Properties

**Consistency:** No contradictions derivable (machine verifiable)

**Completeness:** All intended truths about Advaita structure are derivable

**Independence:** No axiom is derivable from others (each is necessary)

**Categoricity:** The axioms determine the structure up to isomorphism (unique model)
